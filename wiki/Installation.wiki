#how to install zonerama

= Details =

Installation is the same like on every other qt application. Make sure to read the [Requirements] first.

  # Download and extract source code
  # *cd* to the source directory
  # run *qmake*
  # run *make*
  # you now should have a *Zonerama* binary.
  # create one or more merged monitor in Zoneminder:
    * Source: Local
    * Function: None
    * set width and height to equal outputImageHeight/Width
    * Other options are not needet, leave them default if unsure. So sourcepath /dev/video is okay, it isnt used anyway.
  # edit *zonerama.conf* to fit your needs, read [Configuration] carefully.
  # configure your mysql server correctly with group_concat_max_len and max_allowed_packet. See [Requirements] for details.
